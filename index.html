          <h3>College</h3>

         Hi, I'm Elliott. I am an early-career manager of people and processes. I grew up in New York
          and went to college at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. I majored in United States History
          with a particular focus on how communities tend to share socioeconomic trajectories. For example, I spent some time trying to understand why some minority
          groups have gained disproportionate wealth while others have struggled. I also studied some business stuff--mostly strategy and
          finance.


    <h3>Career</h3>
          After school, I joined Teach for America as a special education teacher. I worked for two years on <thead>
            the west side of Chicago. I then joined McMaster-Carr, an industrial supply company, as a management candidate. I have
            worked at the company for about two and a half years. In that time, I have held roles as an operations analyst, publishing supervisor,
            and product and information database manager. I currently lead a team of 17 people responsible for the mantainence of a product selection of
            over 550,000 SKUs.
